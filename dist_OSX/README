# Installation:





# Program:
The program will ask you to input two parameters.
The first one is the redshift of the galaxy you want to examine.
The second one is an option whether to display the positions (frequencies) of the Lyman breaks (Lyman limit at 912A and Lyman alpha at 1216A) and the Balmer break (3646A). Default is ’N’ (No).

The program will then display the spectra of galaxies, which are computed by the BC03 synthesized stellar population model.
Dust extinction is not applied, meaning these are all “dust-free” spectra.
The exponential decay timescales of the star formation rate of the galaxies, denoted by “tau”, are 0.1, 0.3, and 1 Gyr respectively, as shown on the title of each panel.
In each panel, spectra of galaxies at different ages are drawn in different colors.

To interact with the figure, first click the 4-way arrow icon at the bottom left control panel.
Now, to pan the figure, simply drag it with the left mouse button.
Zooming can be done by dragging with the right mouse button.
